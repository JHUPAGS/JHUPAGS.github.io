<h1>Our Guide to Being a Grad Student</h1>

<p>
    In the fall of 2016, we had a Wine and Cheese seminar to discuss the various rights, responsibilities, and goals of grad students in general, with the occasional specific aimed towards life at Johns Hopkins. The set of slides from that event can be found here, and is a valuable resource for students at any point during their graduate career.
